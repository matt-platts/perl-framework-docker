# perl-framework-docker

This is the perl framework repo, packaged up in docker with a front end to demo it (an old one, using EXT.js).

After cloning this repo, run the following to pull down the submodules:

- git submodule init
- git submodule update

[For working with submodules, see this link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules]

Once the submodules are updated, run these commands:

- cd scripts
- ./build
- ./run

then navigate to http://localhost/np-portal/
